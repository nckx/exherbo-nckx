SUMMARY="Samba platform core compatibility layer"
DESCRIPTION="
This subsystem ensures that we can always use a certain core set of 
functions and types, that are either provided by the OS or by replacement 
functions / definitions in this subsystem. The aim is to try to stick 
to POSIX functions in here as much as possible. Convenience functions 
that are available on no platform at all belong in other subsystems
(such as LIBUTIL).
