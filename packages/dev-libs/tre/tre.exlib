SUMMARY="Light-weight, POSIX-compliant regular expression matching library"
DESCRIPTION="
TRE is a lightweight, robust, and efficient POSIX-compliant regexp matching
library with some exciting features such as approximate (fuzzy) matching.

The matching algorithm used in TRE uses linear worst-case time in the length of
the text being searched, and quadratic worst-case time in the length of the used
regular expression. In other words, the time complexity of the algorithm is
O(M2N), where M is the length of the regular expression and N is the length of
the text. The used space is also quadratic on the length of the regex, but does
not depend on the searched string. This quadratic behaviour occurs only on
pathological cases which are probably very rare in practice.
