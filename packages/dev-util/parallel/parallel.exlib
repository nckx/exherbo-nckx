SUMMARY="Build and execute shell command lines from standard input in parallel"
DESCRIPTION="
GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel locally or using
remote computers. A job is typically a single command or a small script that
has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The typical input is a list
of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, a list of URLs, or a list of
tables.
