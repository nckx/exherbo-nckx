* Paludis doesn't seem to run pkg_p{re,ost}rm on package upgrades. Find out
  whether this is a bug or a(n un)documented feature.

* Find a better solution for x509.genkey than the current symbolic link hack.

* Actually, find a better solution for module signing keys in general.

  They're really worthless if kept around on the build host (any malware could
  use them to sign its modules), but deleting them after building the kernel
  makes it impossible to sign out-of-tree modules. That *is* the point, but...
  bleh.
